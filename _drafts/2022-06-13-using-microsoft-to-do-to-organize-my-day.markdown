title:  "Using Microsoft To Do to organize my day"
---

I suffer from [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and I've taken a step recently to work on this by myself and the aid of a psychologist.
During the consults with my psychologist, we realized that one of the things that makes my symptoms worse is organizing my day. I'm pretty bad at making a planning and sticking to it.

Some of the things I do:

- Start my day with opening my Email and at on the incoming Emails and tickets
- Get distracted from my daily goals with things that pop-up in between
  - Email (both personal and work related)
  - Tickets
  - Questions via chat
  - Phone calls
  - Things I read on blogs
  - Personal distractions like family, chores, etc.

Fact is, I get distracted a lot and during the day, I usually forget about my planning.

One of the things I'm trying to adopt is [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) app, which can be used for .. well, to-do-lists.
It's very easy to use and you can sign in online using the [web application](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) or download the app from the Microsoft store for Windows 10 or the iOS or Android app
